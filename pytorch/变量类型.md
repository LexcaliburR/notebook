# torch.nn.Parameter

torch.Tensor的子类，作为nn.Module里的参数，是可训练参数
```
A kind of Tensor that is to be considered a module parameter.

Parameters are Tensor subclasses, that have a very special property when used with Module s - when they’re assigned as Module attributes they are automatically added to the list of its parameters, and will appear e.g. in parameters() iterator. Assigning a Tensor doesn’t have such effect. This is because one might want to cache some temporary state, like last hidden state of the RNN, in the model. If there was no such class as Parameter, these temporaries would get registered too.

Parameters

        data (Tensor) – parameter tensor.

        requires_grad (bool, optional) – if the parameter requires gradient. See Locally disabling gradient computation for more details. Default: True
